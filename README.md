# About

ReplaceCSV is a python library for replacing strings in a CSV file. It was created by the need to exchange values that had a comma for a dot (Ex.: 14,592 >> 14.592).

## Usage

```python
from replaceCSV import replaceCSV

#Syntax
replaceCSV(nome_do_arquivo (string), char_q_vai_sair (string), char_q_vai_entrar (string))

#Example of use
replaceCSV('dados.csv', ',', '.')


```
